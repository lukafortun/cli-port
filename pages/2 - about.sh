PAGE_TITLE="About me"
PAGE_CONTENT="Hey, I’m Luka — currently studying software engineering at Polytech Nantes.

I like building systems that actually solve problems: full-stack apps, backend APIs,
self-hosted tools... I enjoy writing clean, maintainable code and figuring out how
things work behind the scenes.

I’ve spent time working with Java, Spring Boot, Docker, and a bit of everything from
C++ to React. I also run my own home server with apps I’ve built and deployed myself."
